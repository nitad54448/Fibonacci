# Fibonacci
Calculate numbers in the Fiboancci series, win 10 installer.
These numbers get very big. For 1M values you'll need several books to write them.

Some benchmark :
I list here the time required and the number of digits of the Nth number in the series (calculated with a regular 2023 PC) and this program:

      10k    5 msec    2090
      50k    60 msec   10450
      100k   200 msec  20899
      500k   5 sec     104494
      10^6   20 sec    208988
      5*10^6 
      10^7   3400 sec  2089877
